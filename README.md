Tinkering With CSS Filter Effects
=============

A simple playground for CSS Filter Effects.

[CSS Filter Effects](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/filters/index.html)  are an experimental part of CSS that aims to bring basic, Instagram or Photoshop-like filters to CSS.

CSS Filter Effects, are not, however, restricted to images. You can apply them to nearly any DOM element.

[This example](http://webinista.github.com/TinkeringWithCSSFilterEffects/) only uses the filter effects functions. It does not allow you to change the `filter-margin-top`, `filter-margin-bottom` `filter-margin-left`, `filter-margin-right` or `filter-margin` properties. Nor does it allow you to use SVG filters or [CSS Shaders](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/css-shaders.html) (custom filters).

One final thing to keep in mind: [CSS Filter Effects](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/filters/index.html) are an experimental part of CSS, with [limited browser support](caniuse.com/#search=css filter). They're not quite ready for prime time.
